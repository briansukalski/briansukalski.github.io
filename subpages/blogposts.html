            <h2>Post 1: Starting Out (Again) - 6/20/22</h2>
            <p>This is really my first attempt at documenting my progression as I continue my journey to become a professional developer. I have some background in coding from my college days at Iowa State University, and took a freshman-level computer science class: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, my sophomore year there. I've been working as a manufacturing engineer for over 3 years, but in January of 2020, I decided that I wanted to become a professional developer, for various reasons that don't need to be explained in detail right now.<br><br>Sporadically, for the last nearly 2 and a half years, I've been learning to code primarily using Codecademy Pro as a teaching resource. The difficulty throughout that time has been staying consistent with my time and effort. I've had some strong weeks and a couple of strong months, but far too many droughts of only a few hours of learning in the span of a month or more. Although I've learned a lot of the principles and basics of programming now, and I've been back on a decent learning routine in the last month, I don't feel any closer to being ready for an entry-level job than I did at the start. I know I have nobody to blame for that but myself. <br><br>Consider this first post a statement of intent and recommitment. This personal website will become the hub of my portfolio as it grows, and a record of my improvement as a web developer as the site gradually transforms from a clunky, ugly, static website into a sleek, intuitive, and interactive site. <br><br>My goal will be to add some new post here at least once a week with updates on my progress: what I'm learning, what I'm working on, and what I'm aiming for. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, this page will resemble an actual blog instead of an extremely long html paragraph element with occasional line breaks inserted to break up the text. Until then, it'll be ugly. But it's a start. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 2: Not a Great Start - 7/13/22</h2>
            <p>So, I'm finally back. So much for at least one post a week. A couple of weeks ago, I was in the process of moving from one apartment to another, and I didn't have access to my PC for a week. I quickly learned that I was not nearly as comfortable using my MacBook for learning to code as I should be. Most of the languages and tools I use on my PC were not yet installed on my laptop, and I found myself not wanting to take the time to get the laptop set up to learn and develop. Then, when I made the move into my new place, I was able to use the disarray and disorganization of my apartment as an excuse to not put much time toward coding. To make a long story short, there's nothing about new learnings or projects to report.<br><br>I have been managing to at least put in a little time every day, but most of those days, it was just 5 minutes or so, enough to do a short review or finish one segment of a Codecademy lesson. I need to lengthen those "off days" to 30 or 40 minutes of work, enough to actually learn or progress on a topic or project.<br><br>Over the rest of the summer months, I'll be focused on building consistency in my commitment. Specifically, that means a minimum of 10 hours of learning and project-building every week, a week-to-week average of 15 hours per week, and a minimum of 30 minutes on any day I have access to one of my computers. That also should mean more frequent updates on learning topics and projects here. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 3: Finishing Review - 7/25/22</h2>
            <p>As I've gotten settled into my new apartment and my routine has started to fall back into place, I've been able to dedicate a little bit more time over the last couple of weeks. The reality is that I'm still not where I want to be, but I'm getting there, trying to make sure I do a little bit every day and keeping my morale up. The plan is to be able to break double digits again in hours this week, after having failed to do so the last several weeks. I'm doing my best to not let bad weeks of low motivation discourage me from coming back to learn again, and I'm doing a better job of that lately.<br><br>On the positive side of things, as I've continued to work through Codecademy's "Full-Stack Engineer" career path, I'm almost up to the point in the curriculum where I was at my peak of commitment early last year. I anticipate I'll surpass that stage this week, and then I'll finally be learning brand new content again. Soon, I'll be learning how to use all the JavaScript I've learned to actually add interactivity to a website, which I'm very excited about.<br><br> In the meantime, though, I still need to get a lot more practice using HTML and CSS to make pages look presentable, which I'm still really struggling with. I've never had much talent for visual art, and I think that my frustration with how my webpages look is an extension of that weakness. Repetition and tutorials will help, and I need to build more stuff myself to learn from experience, which will require more time. Several weeks into the recommitment to coding, this site still looks like something a high-school student created for a computer class in 1998. I can't have that still be true in another 5 weeks. Time to get to work. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 4: Interactivity! - 8/2/22</h2>
            <p>Finally, this site does something other than display text. As my Codecademy curriculum moves beyond the structural and styling languages of HTML and CSS, I'm finally starting to learn how to add scripts to a site and trigger events through user input. So far, the only thing I'm doing is having a gif appear and disappear, but it still felt like a big milestone when I added it.<br><br>Just because I'm into the JavaScript portion of building the front-end of a site, though, doesn't mean I'm done practicing my styling, which is still very weak. I did find during a practice project last week that the page I built was the best-looking one I'd produced so far, which was very encouraging to me. Plain old practice is going to be the key to building up those skills further. It's a little boring, but I think it's a valuable skillset to develop.<br><br>While all the web development learning has been great, I need to start a project or two to work on outside of this site, both to start building out my portfolio and to keep up with some of the skills I learned in the Codecademy computer science path. I have a lot of ideas for projects, but very little clue how to execute them. The only way to learn is to try, though. Here's to a good coding week this week. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 5: The Online Keyboard - 8/13/22</h2>
            <p>I've opened up and developed a new project on this site: a one-octave piano keyboard that users can play either with their own keyboard or with the mouse. The styling of the page has a long way to go, considering the keys still don't look anything like a piano. All of the playing functionality, though is essentially done. I have some ideas for more features to be added to the online keyboard, but I'm very happy with how it's progressed so far.<br><br>I've been having a good week with my development. Within my Codecademy career path, I've moved on to learning slightly more advanced concepts in JavaScript, most recently classes and modules. I'm officially past the point that I had reached in the path last year and am now moving into new territory, which is exciting but will present a greater challenge.<br><br>As I learn more concepts and add more skills, I'll need to come up with projects I can build that will allow me to apply and practice those skills. As I build out any new projects, I'll keep posting updates here. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 6: Refining the Keyboard and New Concepts - 8/18/22</h2>
            <p>Since the last post, there have been a few updates to the keyboard feature. On top of looking more like a keyboard, and utilizing css flexbox to make the keys adaptable in size, the played key now highlights in dark green when clicked on or selected with the keyboard. I want to do more with the styling design to get the black keys overlaid over the white keys the way they'd be on a real piano, but I'm happy that the appearance is getting closer to an approximation of real life.<br><br>In my Codecademy path, I've been learning about testing this week, and have initialized a package.json file for this project to contain any tests I implement in the future. So far, though, nothing. I've been learning about TDD (test-driven development), which is an approach that makes logical sense to me but goes against my instincts to build whatever I want to build first, then test later. It will be a tough adjustment if I start using that approach. I'll have to do more research to find out how common TDD is in real professional development teams. Either way, I should start writing some tests for my projects as I develop them. Doing it while my features are still very simple will pay off when I start building more complex applications that I won't realistically be able to manually test.<br><br>I also need to emphasize developing other documentation for my projects, especially READMEs. It's harder for my to get myself to put the time into that stuff because it's definitely the unsexy side of coding, but I realize it's going to be an important skill to develop, especially if and when I ever start developing in a team. Hopefully, that will be sooner than later. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 7: Starting with APIs - 9/5/22</h2>
            <p>My Codecademy coursework has now guided me through asynchronous programming in JavaScript and how that ties into using APIs. The prospect of being able to incorporate APIs into my own projects is really exciting to me, because it'll be the first time I'm able to use data in a project that I myself don't create or copy in. APIs open up a whole new world of possible projects. Now I just need to decide what I want to build.<br><br>As for the rest of this site, I've started building up a page where users will be able to play the game 2048 in their browser. I'm still working through the game mechanics in JavaScript, and I've done very little styling, but my eventual goal is to incorporate some back-end that will allow users to save their high scores. I'm not sure what that will look like yet since I've learned nothing about back-end to this point, but I think when I get there it will be a good simple introductory implementation.<br><br>Motivation has been tough for me to come by the last couple of weeks. As the topics in my coursework get progressively denser and less familiar, my progress is slowing down, which I think is making me feel discouraged. I'm nearly to back-end, though, which I see as my area of greater interest. Once I get there, I think the expanded possibilities for project-building will give me plenty of opportunities to build things I'm excited about. I just have to keep pushing until I reach that point. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 8: Growing the Toolbox - 9/12/22</h2>
            <p>Last week was the best week I've had, in terms of time committed to coding, since January of 2021. I'm very proud of that. With the increased time committed to learning and building, my progress in my coursework has accelerated, and suddenly I'm flying through concepts and topics that are starting to get more advanced.<br><br>Just in the last week, I've learned about the event loop in JavaScript, callback functions, promises, the async... await syntax, JSON, and now I'm getting into React as well: the JSX syntax, components, props, and state.<br><br>I feel more and more like I'm learning the kind of tools now that will allow me to build more complex and interesting project. The challenge now is figuring out what those are going to be. These are the things I need to build to ultimately solidify my understanding of all these new concepts, not to mention I'll need a good portfolio when my job search eventually starts.<br><br>Speaking of the projects I have been working on, though, I've finished building a functional version of the in-browser 2048 game I was working on last week on my personal GitHub pages website. Since I still know no back-end, there's no saving of any data, like high scores, but it's fully playable now, and from my testing, it behaves the same way as the iPhone app I spent so much time playing in high school and college. 2048 was great practice for me setting up event listeners, building logic based on the contents of HTML components, and changing those values dynamically. This week, the goal is to keep the positive momentum going and find another sizable project to start working on. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 9: React and APIs - 10/31/22</h2>
            <p>Through a combination of less dedicated time to coding and focus on a Codecademy challenge project, I've been neglecting my personal site, but I haven't stopped learning completely. Life has gotten busy, and I've made less time for coding in the last several weeks, but I've still been chipping away.<br><br>The big project for Codecademy is a React app that uses the Spotify API to build and save a playlist to a user's (in this case my own) profile. It's been a steep learning curve. The React components of the project, while challenging, were a great learning experience for me and allowed me to get repetition setting up components, passing props from one component to another, and updating state.<br><br>The API side of the project is where I really hit a wall. This was my first experience using any kind of API for a project, and it felt like trying to read and write a foreign language. Ultimately, I had to rely heavily on a video walkthrough of the project to get the search function running. There's still a long way to go on this project, including an entire second section, and it's been a grind at times, but I think going through the steps will open doors for me to pursue much more interesting personal projects after this is complete. I'll elaborate more on those as they take shape. Talk to you next time.</p>
