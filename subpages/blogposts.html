            <h2>Blog Post 1: Starting Out (Again) - 6/20/22</h2>
            <p>This is really my first attempt at documenting my progression as I continue my journey to become a professional developer. I have some background in coding from my college days at Iowa State University, and took a freshman-level computer science class: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, my sophomore year there. I've been working as a manufacturing engineer for over 3 years, but in January of 2020, I decided that I wanted to become a professional developer, for various reasons that don't need to be explained in detail right now.<br><br>Sporadically, for the last nearly 2 and a half years, I've been learning to code primarily using Codecademy Pro as a teaching resource. The difficulty throughout that time has been staying consistent with my time and effort. I've had some strong weeks and a couple of strong months, but far too many droughts of only a few hours of learning in the span of a month or more. Although I've learned a lot of the principles and basics of programming now, and I've been back on a decent learning routine in the last month, I don't feel any closer to being ready for an entry-level job than I did at the start. I know I have nobody to blame for that but myself. <br><br>Consider this first post a statement of intent and recommitment. This personal website will become the hub of my portfolio as it grows, and a record of my improvement as a web developer as the site gradually transforms from a clunky, ugly, static website into a sleek, intuitive, and interactive site. <br><br>My goal will be to add some new post here at least once a week with updates on my progress: what I'm learning, what I'm working on, and what I'm aiming for. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, this page will resemble an actual blog instead of an extremely long html paragraph element with occasional line breaks inserted to break up the text. Until then, it'll be ugly. But it's a start. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post 2: Not a Great Start - 7/13/22</h2>
            <p>So, I'm finally back. So much for at least one post a week. A couple of weeks ago, I was in the process of moving from one apartment to another, and I didn't have access to my PC for a week. I quickly learned that I was not nearly as comfortable using my MacBook for learning to code as I should be. Most of the languages and tools I use on my PC were not yet installed on my laptop, and I found myself not wanting to take the time to get the laptop set up to learn and develop. Then, when I made the move into my new place, I was able to use the disarray and disorganization of my apartment as an excuse to not put much time toward coding. To make a long story short, there's nothing about new learnings or projects to report.<br><br>I have been managing to at least put in a little time every day, but most of those days, it was just 5 minutes or so, enough to do a short review or finish one segment of a Codecademy lesson. I need to lengthen those "off days" to 30 or 40 minutes of work, enough to actually learn or progress on a topic or project.<br><br>Over the rest of the summer months, I'll be focused on building consistency in my commitment. Specifically, that means a minimum of 10 hours of learning and project-building every week, a week-to-week average of 15 hours per week, and a minimum of 30 minutes on any day I have access to one of my computers. That also should mean more frequent updates on learning topics and projects here. Talk to you next time.</p>
