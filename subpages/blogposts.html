        <h2>Blog Post 1: Starting Out (Again) - 6/20/22</h2>
        <p>This is really my first attempt at documenting my progression as I continue my journey to become a professional developer. I have some background in coding from my college days at Iowa State University, and took a freshman-level computer science class: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, my sophomore year there. I've been working as a manufacturing engineer for over 3 years, but in January of 2020, I decided that I wanted to become a professional developer, for various reasons that don't need to be explained in detail right now.<br><br>Sporadically, for the last nearly 2 and a half years, I've been learning to code primarily using Codecademy Pro as a teaching resource. The difficulty throughout that time has been staying consistent with my time and effort. I've had some strong weeks and a couple of strong months, but far too many droughts of only a few hours of learning in the span of a month or more. Although I've learned a lot of the principles and basics of programming now, and I've been back on a decent learning routine in the last month, I don't feel any closer to being ready for an entry-level job than I did at the start. I know I have nobody to blame for that but myself. <br><br>Consider this first post a statement of intent and recommitment. This personal website will become the hub of my portfolio as it grows, and a record of my improvement as a web developer as the site gradually transforms from a clunky, ugly, static website into a sleek, intuitive, and interactive site. <br><br>My goal will be to add some new post here at least once a week with updates on my progress: what I'm learning, what I'm working on, and what I'm aiming for. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, this page will resemble an actual blog instead of an extremely long html paragraph element with occasional line breaks inserted to break up the text. Until then, it'll be ugly. But it's a start. Talk to you next time.</p>
