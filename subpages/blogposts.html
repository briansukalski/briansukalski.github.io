            <h2>Post 1: Starting Out (Again) - 6/20/22</h2>
            <p>This is really my first attempt at documenting my progression as I continue my journey to become a professional developer. I have some background in coding from my college days at Iowa State University, and took a freshman-level computer science class: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, my sophomore year there. I've been working as a manufacturing engineer for over 3 years, but in January of 2020, I decided that I wanted to become a professional developer, for various reasons that don't need to be explained in detail right now.<br><br>Sporadically, for the last nearly 2 and a half years, I've been learning to code primarily using Codecademy Pro as a teaching resource. The difficulty throughout that time has been staying consistent with my time and effort. I've had some strong weeks and a couple of strong months, but far too many droughts of only a few hours of learning in the span of a month or more. Although I've learned a lot of the principles and basics of programming now, and I've been back on a decent learning routine in the last month, I don't feel any closer to being ready for an entry-level job than I did at the start. I know I have nobody to blame for that but myself. <br><br>Consider this first post a statement of intent and recommitment. This personal website will become the hub of my portfolio as it grows, and a record of my improvement as a web developer as the site gradually transforms from a clunky, ugly, static website into a sleek, intuitive, and interactive site. <br><br>My goal will be to add some new post here at least once a week with updates on my progress: what I'm learning, what I'm working on, and what I'm aiming for. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, this page will resemble an actual blog instead of an extremely long html paragraph element with occasional line breaks inserted to break up the text. Until then, it'll be ugly. But it's a start. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 2: Not a Great Start - 7/13/22</h2>
            <p>So, I'm finally back. So much for at least one post a week. A couple of weeks ago, I was in the process of moving from one apartment to another, and I didn't have access to my PC for a week. I quickly learned that I was not nearly as comfortable using my MacBook for learning to code as I should be. Most of the languages and tools I use on my PC were not yet installed on my laptop, and I found myself not wanting to take the time to get the laptop set up to learn and develop. Then, when I made the move into my new place, I was able to use the disarray and disorganization of my apartment as an excuse to not put much time toward coding. To make a long story short, there's nothing about new learnings or projects to report.<br><br>I have been managing to at least put in a little time every day, but most of those days, it was just 5 minutes or so, enough to do a short review or finish one segment of a Codecademy lesson. I need to lengthen those "off days" to 30 or 40 minutes of work, enough to actually learn or progress on a topic or project.<br><br>Over the rest of the summer months, I'll be focused on building consistency in my commitment. Specifically, that means a minimum of 10 hours of learning and project-building every week, a week-to-week average of 15 hours per week, and a minimum of 30 minutes on any day I have access to one of my computers. That also should mean more frequent updates on learning topics and projects here. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 3: Finishing Review - 7/25/22</h2>
            <p>As I've gotten settled into my new apartment and my routine has started to fall back into place, I've been able to dedicate a little bit more time over the last couple of weeks. The reality is that I'm still not where I want to be, but I'm getting there, trying to make sure I do a little bit every day and keeping my morale up. The plan is to be able to break double digits again in hours this week, after having failed to do so the last several weeks. I'm doing my best to not let bad weeks of low motivation discourage me from coming back to learn again, and I'm doing a better job of that lately.<br><br>On the positive side of things, as I've continued to work through Codecademy's "Full-Stack Engineer" career path, I'm almost up to the point in the curriculum where I was at my peak of commitment early last year. I anticipate I'll surpass that stage this week, and then I'll finally be learning brand new content again. Soon, I'll be learning how to use all the JavaScript I've learned to actually add interactivity to a website, which I'm very excited about.<br><br> In the meantime, though, I still need to get a lot more practice using HTML and CSS to make pages look presentable, which I'm still really struggling with. I've never had much talent for visual art, and I think that my frustration with how my webpages look is an extension of that weakness. Repetition and tutorials will help, and I need to build more stuff myself to learn from experience, which will require more time. Several weeks into the recommitment to coding, this site still looks like something a high-school student created for a computer class in 1998. I can't have that still be true in another 5 weeks. Time to get to work. Talk to you next time.</p>

            <h2>Post 4: Interactivity! - 8/2/22</h2>
            <p>Finally, this site does something other than display text. As my Codecademy curriculum moves beyond the structural and styling languages of HTML and CSS, I'm finally starting to learn how to add scripts to a site and trigger events through user input. So far, the only thing I'm doing is having a gif appear and disappear, but it still felt like a big milestone when I added it.<br><br>Just because I'm into the JavaScript portion of building the front-end of a site, though, doesn't mean I'm done practicing my styling, which is still very weak. I did find during a practice project last week that the page I built was the best-looking one I'd produced so far, which was very encouraging to me. Plain old practice is going to be the key to building up those skills further. It's a little boring, but I think it's a valuable skillset to develop.<br><br>While all the web development learning has been great, I need to start a project or two to work on outside of this site, both to start building out my portfolio and to keep up with some of the skills I learned in the Codecademy computer science path. I have a lot of ideas for projects, but very little clue how to execute them. The only way to learn is to try, though. Here's to a good coding week this week. Talk to you next time.</p>
