        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I am an industrial engineer aspiring to make a career change into software development. Currently, I am focused on building up a general development skillset both to find my own personal areas of interest and to make myself a more well-rounded candidate for an entry-level position in the field. This personal site will be further developed as my web front-end and back-end skills grow.</p>

            <p>User privacy is a top priority for me, and I am firmly committed to never collecting user data on this site. At the moment, that promise is backed up by the fact that I have none of the knowledge or skills required to build a website capable of collecting and storing user data.</p>
